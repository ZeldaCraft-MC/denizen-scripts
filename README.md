# denizen-scripts

A dumping ground for scripts created for the ZeldaCraft Minecraft server and community.

## Want to make an impact? Help us script!

I have seen some people interested in learning how to script/code for this server. While I would normally recommend most folks to use the official Denizen Discord for this plugin, I have set up a much smaller Discord server where you can learn how to code for this server right beside your friends. This is open to everyone, so if coding your ideas for ZC is something you'd be interested in, feel free to hop in and participate.

The topics are broken up into discord channels, and there is a spot to ask me (and others who learn how to script) questions you might have along the way. I recommend going through the channels in order. To help you remember where you are along the way, I recommend reacting to the steps with a âœ… as you do them.

You can take the skills you learn with scripting far. Obviously in this server itself, working up to a Developer/Admin/GM position, but also in life. I used my Denizen skills to kickstart an entire programming career irl.
This is a resource I am happy to help with, so feel free to ask me questions and for help as you learn!
